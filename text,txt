Issues Regarding Previous Employment


As Discussed Yesterday regarding the mail for Previous Employment issues Please find the details below

1. For (Astar,Ubona, TLG(Publicis Sapient)), my working days in these companies is very less and when I joined ITC I didn't have the service letters because I left these company early due to personal issues.So I was not considering that experience in my resume at the time of joining ITC.

2. For Astar Experience was only for one month and For Ubona Technologies experience was only for 4 months. Now I have contacted them and received the service letter which I am attaching in this mail.  

3. For TLG(Publicis Sapient) since I have worked only for 8 days .They denied giving the service letter for that duration . Attaching response screenshot in this mail.

4. For Exit date in Uan that was raised earlier For that I have contacted my previous companies and now exit date is also updated in my service history.Please refer the screenshot which I attached in the mail.
